**Thought Process**

This inventory management system was developed for Shoprite Group Limited. 

Aim: This inventory and management system is used to manage the outlets' users (sellers) and stocks.

**Background:**

This application was developed using C#, and SQL Server was used for the database. 

**The application is made up of six screens, namely:**

Splash Screen,
Login Screen,
Category Screen,
Product Screen, 
Seller Screen, 
Selling Screen.

**The application has two sections, which are:**

Admin session,
Seller session

The **admin** session allows the admin to access the category, product, and seller screens.  

On the category screen, the admin can add, edit, and delete categories. 

On the product screen, the admin can add, edit, and delete products. 

On the seller screen, the admin can add, edit, and delete sellers. 

The **seller** session allows a seller to access the selling screen.  

On the selling screen, the seller has the ability to log details of sales based on purchases made. On checkout, the seller screen contains a grid that displays the amount, name, and quantity of the product purchased by a customer. Below this grid, the total amount for the product is displayed in cedis. 

There is also a sale list view that displays the history of purchases and includes an ID, seller name, date, and amount. The sale list is **printable**. 

_**NB:** This system has been tested, and it is fully functional._
